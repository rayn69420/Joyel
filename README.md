Joyel emulates certain controller functionalities by using your mouse inputs.
It's purpose is to prove that regular PC peripheral can be viable for racing games.

Install:
- Install the [ViGEmBusDriver](https://vigembusdriver.com/).
- Start with JoyelWPF.exe

Usage:
- The tool tracks the cursor position (horizontal) to calculate a steering value.
- You can send the steering value to the virtual controller with the left mouse button (LMB).
- You can cancel the steering value using your regular keyboard steering input or by pressing the right mouse button (RMB).
- With the "Padding" setting you can tweak the amount of pixels ignored from the width of the screen. For example if you have a 100px padding, you will reach 100% steering when you reach 100px distance from the border of the screen with your cursor.
- The "Deadzone" value is used to ignore the center x percent of the screen. If you have 10% deadzone the steering value will be always zero under 10%.
- When the "Mouse Only mode" is enabled, your steering will always sent to the virtual joystick. Your RMB will function as a "Left Shoulder" button, your LMB will function as an "X" button.
